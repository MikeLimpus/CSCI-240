#Material

This exam will cover material from Chapter 4, Chapter 5, and Chapter 6 of the text. To prepare for the exam, be sure you:

    Understand the five components of the von Neumann model: memory, processing unit, input, output, and the control unit
    Understand the components which make up a computer instruction
    Understand the six phases of the instruction cycle: fetch, decode, evaluate, address, fetch operands, and store result.
    Understand the seven components specified by the ISA: the memory organization, registers, the instruction set,  opcodes, data types, addressing modes, and condition codes
    Know how to execute operation instructions such as ADD, logical AND, and logical NOT
    Know how to execute data movement instructions such as LD, LDI, LDR, LEA, ST, STI, and STR
    Know how to execute control instructions such as BR, JMP, and TRAP to simulate conditional execution

Question types include Fill-in-the-Blank, True/False, LC-3 Program Snippets, Short Answers, and Program Interpretation.

In addition to the material above, I recommend you specifically study the following:

    Combining arithmetic functions from Lab: LC-3 (Section 2) to form more complicated arithmetic expressions. For example, given your knowledge on computing LaTeX: X-Y X − Y , you may be asked to calculate LaTeX: X\:-\:\left(Y\:-\:Z\right) X − ( Y − Z )
    Applying DeMorgan's Law
    Non-Operations
