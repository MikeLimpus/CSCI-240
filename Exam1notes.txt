1)  Convert Between Binary (2's complement), Dec, Oct, Hex
	-You will have a large amount of these and are thus expected to do them relatively quickly ( maybe 30 seconds)
	-Largest value : 8 bits
	-Powers of 2:
	0	1
	1	2
	2	4
	3	8
	4	16
	5	32
	6	64
	7	128
	1000 0000 - 1 = 0111 1111 = 128 - 1 = 127
2) Adding/Subtracting Binary number
	-Do not worry about oct or hex
	-Operations are assumming 8 bits, therefore
		-Know when and how to do sign padding in the event we have a 7 
		bit or less string
		-Know how to detect overflow
3) Bitwise operations on binary numbers
	- AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR
	- Demorgan's Law might help
	- Logical identitois may help too
	- 0 OR X = X
	- 1 AND X = X
Transistors/Digital Logic/Digital Circuits
1) Know the difference between p-type and n- type transistors
	-Be able to draw their schematics
	-Be able to show how when combined they can form a CMOS
		-Be able to draw its schematic
2) Do not memorize the schematics for any of the logical opertions
	- NAND, AND, NOR, OR, XOR
DO MEMORIZE NOT TRANSISTOR
3) Be able to determine if a transistor level schematic is valid, also be able 
to draw its truth table

Memory: 
 -Know what addressability means/is
 -Know how to calculate the amount of memory given the number of registers and 
the size or width of each register 
 -Know how many bits are required for a given amount of registers and vice versa
 -Be familiar with the gate-level circuit of memory
	-Know which combinational circuits form memory 
Digital Circuits 
	-Given a digital circuit (the thing with the logic gates) draw its truth table
	-Given a series of inputs, determine its output
	-Know what it means for a digital circuit to be a storage element
	-Know the implications of a programmable logic array
		-That is, what does it say about the digital circuit given an fixed number of inputs and outputs
	-Be able to apply DeMorgan's Laws (intentionally plural) 
	-Given a digital circuit, construct the Boolean expression for its output 
	-What properties does a truth table have given a number of inputs 
	-Again, make a truth table from a digital circuit
