# Exam 3
## Material

This exam will cover material from Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 of the text. To prepare for the exam, be sure you:
  

    Know the components of an assembly language instruction
        Indicate the components of each assembly language instruction (mandartory and optional)
        Identify valid/invalid assembly language instructions(Be able to indicate what the components are and indicate whether a given assembly langauge instruction is valid)
    Understand what a pseduo-op (assembler directive) is.
        Be able to identify, describe, and use the five available pseduo-operations
    Understand what actions are taken during the first and second pass of the assembly process
    Are able to construct a symbol table from an assembly language program
    Understand how input/output devices interact with device registers to hold data being transferred between the device and the computer or maintain status information about the device.
    Be able to differentiate between memory-mapped I/O versus special I/O Instructions
    Learn the difference between synchronous and asynchronous instructions
    Learn the difference between interrupt-driven versus polling interactions
    Understand what is required for interrupt-driven I/O to occur (including priority)

Question types include Fill-in-the-Blank, True/False, LC-3 Program Snippets, Short Answers, Program Interpretation, and a Programming Component.

### Psuedo-ops

  - Not technically LC-3 instructions
  - Operators for the assembler, not for the LC-3 itself
